# OtherNet

OtherNet is a networking experiment that aims to build from scratch a web-like network using the lessons learned since the early-90's. The Othernet's OtherWeb will be a clean, easy to read and parse yaml-like text that generates real time GUI (initially, it will be GTK+) application on the desktop. This will be an experiment to ascertain feasability of this idea.
