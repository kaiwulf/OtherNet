# OtherNet

OtherNet is a networking experiment that aims to build from scratch a web-like network using the lessons learned since the early-90's. The Othernet's OtherWeb will be a clean, yaml-like (in ease of reading and parseing, but not necessarily markup) hypertext called Manic Text Hypertext Language (MTHL). The internet browser will act as a GUI container, maintaining a boundary between the device and the OtherNet. Within this container, GUI widgets will be dynamically linked according to the Manic Text (initially, it will be implemented in GTK+ but in the long term a custom GUI widget will be developed) creating a fast and desktop-like experience for the user. This will be an experiment to ascertain feasability of this idea. See the beige paper for more information.
