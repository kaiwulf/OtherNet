# OtherNet

OtherNet is a networking experiment to rebuild a web-like network. The Othernet's OtherWeb will be a clean, easy to read and parse yaml-like text that generates real time GUI (initially, it will be GTK+) application on the desktop. This will be an experiment to ascertain feasability of this idea.
