# OtherNet

OtherNet is a networking experiment that aims to build from scratch a web-like network using the lessons learned since the early-90's. The Othernet's OtherWeb will be a clean, yaml-like (in ease of reading and parseing, but not necessarily markup) hypertext that generates real time GUI (initially, it will be GTK+) applications on the desktop. This will be an experiment to ascertain feasability of this idea.
