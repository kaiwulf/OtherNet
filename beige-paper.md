"OtherNet" is the name for a new internet paradigm. It will serve as a space for netizens to return to the norms of the traditional internet, before special interests, e-commerce and social media fundamentally transformed the norms of the internet. It does not seek to be a replacement for the existing internet but a compliment.

To maintain an ecosystem that fosters the values of the OtherNet, rules will be necessary to curate the process of growth of the OtherNet. This is by no means difinitive. I wrote this in the spur of the moment while high on coffee.

Terms used:

    OtherNet: The name for a new concept of internet freedom. The OtherNet is a new network protocol to create a space for free expression minded, thoughtful people to communicate, innovate and freely share knowledge and wisom.
    OtherWeb: The Web for the OtherNet written in Manic Text Hypertext Language (MTHL).
    Internet: The traditional internet. This includes the world wide web, the physical network of the internet, its servers, routers, etc.

1. All e-commerce will be banned.
2. Free server space for homepages will be mandatory, provided by non-profit nodes who volunteer their resources for this project. Buying your own server space is allowed and optional.
3. The OtherNet will be a neutral zone where free expression is protected. Neutrality is necessary to maintain social cohesion. When sides are taken by institutions in politics, in which not everyone agrees, what constitutes our reality is a matter of who wields the most political power (an undesirable situation for any society). What will not be allowed are the following:
 
    a) Illegal and illicit activity will be banned and reported to authorities. Illicit and illegal activity includes activities, such as: selling of drugs, exploitive content such as CSE (child sexual exploitation), threats of violence, using the OtherNet to harm others and institutions.
 
    b) "Harm" and "Violence" are defined as destruction to a person, their reputation or property.
 
    c) Actions which do not constitute as "Harm" (in an actionable way) or "Violence" include: offensiveness, insensitivity, being perceived as not being inclusive, etc. Social norms rewarding people for being decent will be assumed to be adequate to handle undesirable behavior.
 
    d) Political speech which has been banned by governments but does no harm or violence in the senses mentioned above will be protected, so as to live up to the spirit of protecting free expression and resisting oppressive regimes.
 
    e) These terms will be rewritten and reshaped as necessary in order to retain the original spirit more rigorously.

4. The OtherNet will be a network of Nodes connected to each other over an abstracted meta-net overlaying the Internet.

    a) OtherNet newtork packets will be layered, with TCP/IP a protocol consisting of the outer layer, an SSH layer for security, and lastly the OtherNet protocol.

    b) The nodes of the OtherNet will have a 1-to-1 mapping of the OtherNet addresses and their Internet IP address.

    c) This abstraction allows for the existing infrastructure to be utilized yet freeing up the OtherNet to innovate in protocol technology; while simultaneously allowing new network infrustructure to be laid exclusively for the OtherNet further down the line.

    d) The use of blockchain technology will be explored, to ascertain if it will be condusive to running the OtherNet.

5. The OtherNet will be accessed through the terminal and a GUI based Manic Text Hypertext Language (MTHL). An MTHL browser dynamically renders GUI widgets to create a desktop experience while browsing the web (and simultaneously simplifying development of OtherWeb pages).
